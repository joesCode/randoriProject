==============

Randori is a training tool that generates randomized content for computer science instruction. Randori can generate vulnerable source code and a key describing the flaws in the file or files created.   Randori randomly chooses content from templates, and generates output files that contain that content. It also generates a key associated with that content from the template. This application can generate a user defined number of files and keys, making it suitable for use in the classroom.
